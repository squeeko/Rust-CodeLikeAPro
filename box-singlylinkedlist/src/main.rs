/*
In Rust, self and Self mean two difference things.

self refers to the current module or object.
Self refers to the type of the current module or object.

One of the examples that clarifies this difference is the implementation of PartialEq. Letâ€™s imagine that we want to implement PartialEq for an struct.

struct Employee {
  name: String,
  next_meeting: MeetingType
}

impl PartialEq for Employee {
  fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool { // &self = refers to the current module or object
                                          other: &Self = refers to the type of the current module or object, this type is an "Employee" type
        self.name == other.name
    }
}
